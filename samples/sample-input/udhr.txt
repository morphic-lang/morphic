preamble
whereas
recognition
of
the
inherent
dignity
and
of
the
equal
and
inalienable
rights
of
all
members
of
the
human
family
is
the
foundation
of
freedom
justice
and
peace
in
the
world
whereas
disregard
and
contempt
for
human
rights
have
resulted
in
barbarous
acts
which
have
outraged
the
conscience
of
mankind
and
the
advent
of
a
world
in
which
human
beings
shall
enjoy
freedom
of
speech
and
belief
and
freedom
from
fear
and
want
has
been
proclaimed
as
the
highest
aspiration
of
the
common
people
whereas
it
is
essential
if
man
is
not
to
be
compelled
to
have
recourse
as
a
last
resort
to
rebellion
against
tyranny
and
oppression
that
human
rights
should
be
protected
by
the
rule
of
law
whereas
it
is
essential
to
promote
the
development
of
friendly
relations
between
nations
whereas
the
peoples
of
the
united
nations
have
in
the
charter
reaffirmed
their
faith
in
fundamental
human
rights
in
the
dignity
and
worth
of
the
human
person
and
in
the
equal
rights
of
men
and
women
and
have
determined
to
promote
social
progress
and
better
standards
of
life
in
larger
freedom
whereas
member
states
have
pledged
themselves
to
achieve
in
co-operation
with
the
united
nations
the
promotion
of
universal
respect
for
and
observance
of
human
rights
and
fundamental
freedoms
whereas
a
common
understanding
of
these
rights
and
freedoms
is
of
the
greatest
importance
for
the
full
realization
of
this
pledge
now
therefore
the
general
assembly
proclaims
this
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
as
a
common
standard
of
achievement
for
all
peoples
and
all
nations
to
the
end
that
every
individual
and
every
organ
of
society
keeping
this
declaration
constantly
in
mind
shall
strive
by
teaching
and
education
to
promote
respect
for
these
rights
and
freedoms
and
by
progressive
measures
national
and
international
to
secure
their
universal
and
effective
recognition

observance

among
the
peoples
of

themselves
